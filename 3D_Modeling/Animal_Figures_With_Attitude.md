# Miniature Animals with Attitude

## Project Overview  
This project focused on designing five stylized, expressive animal figurines—raccoon, lemur, otter, llama, and capybara—each with distinct “attitude.” The primary goals were to develop modular, support-free 3D printable models optimized for FDM printing, and to enhance sculpting, coloring, and slicing skills using industry-standard tools.

**Objects:** Miniature Animal Figurines (x5)  
Each design featured unique postures and facial expressions to capture personality and charm. The models were created to be editable, modular, and 3D print-ready.

## Modeling Process  

### Sculpting  
**Software:** Nomad Sculpt  
- Initial forms were blocked out in Fusion 360, ensuring measurements met client requirements.
- Details and colours were created using Nomad Sculpt, with a focus on capturing cohesive stylized animals and expressions.  
- Modular body part separation was implemented for easy editing and reuse.

### Coloring & Slicing  
**Software:** Bambu Studio  
- Used Bambu Studio for detailed color application and to check printability.  
- Ensured designs were FDM-friendly by avoiding overhangs and eliminating the need for support structures.  
- Models were oriented and tested for support-free printing across common FDM setups.

## Design Considerations  
- **Support-Free Design:** All figurines were specifically designed to avoid the need for print supports in FDM printing, streamlining the printing process.  
- **Modularity:** Limbs and body parts were segmented to support reconfiguration or minor adjustments without requiring full model redesign.  
- **Character Styling:** Each animal was given a distinct attitude—e.g., mischievous raccoon, worried otter to emphasize individuality and visual appeal.

## Conclusion  
This project brought together design, modeling, and technical 3D printing workflows to produce a cohesive set of expressive animal miniatures. It emphasized creative character design alongside practical manufacturing constraints, offering valuable experience in digital sculpting, modular design, and FDM optimization.
