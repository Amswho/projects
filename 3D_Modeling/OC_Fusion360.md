### Autodesk Fusion: Design and Model

**Project Overview**  
This project aimed to design and model a detailed, original figure, combining creativity and technical skill in Autodesk Fusion. The goal was to challenge our abilities by tackling a complex design, pushing the boundaries of both creativity and precision.

**Planning & Sketches**  
- **Initial Ideas & Inspiration**:  
  The design process began with brainstorming and gathering inspiration. Rough sketches were made to visualize the concept.  
- **Chosen Idea & Breakdown**:  
  Once a design was selected, it was expanded upon and broken down into key components. The sketches included approximate measurements and potential assembly considerations.

**Use Case**:  
The project focused on creating a detailed figure that tested both the artistic and technical aspects of design.

**Modeling Process**

1. **Sketch Import & Reference**:  
   Rather than relying solely on parameters, construction sketches were used as sizing guidelines. These sketches were imported into Autodesk Fusion as a canvas, helping to define the figureâ€™s proportions and details.

2. **Modeling with Forms**:  
   The design was built using forms, a sculpting-like technique where faces and edges were pushed, pulled, and rotated. Subdivisions were added when necessary to refine the shape and add detail.

3. **Complex Forms**:  
   For more intricate elements like hair, arms, hands, and accessories, different forms were used to create each part. Once each section was sculpted, the individual parts were combined once the form was finalized.

**Key Features & Details**

- **Assembly & Attachments**:  
  A hole was added in the figure to ensure the proper attachment of elements, such as the bangs, during the assembly process. This ensured that the facial features aligned correctly.

- **Final Body Design**:  
  The torso, arms, and lower body were modeled using the same approach, refining the form through manipulation and adjustments to ensure all elements fit together seamlessly.
