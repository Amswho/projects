# Autodesk Fusion Cats and Joints
## Project Overview
This project aimed to design and model a cat figurine with parts connected by ball joints using Fusion 360. The goal was to test both artistic and technical skills in creating movable and detailed pieces while focusing on parametric design for ease of modification.

### Object: Cat Figurine with Ball Joints
The initial brainstorming focused on exploring different variations of the cat figurine's mobility using ball joints. The design was inspired by existing figures, which provided rough dimensions and use-case references. The sketches included different joint placements and sizes for flexibility in movement.

- **Final Sketches**: Final design sketches focused on key body parts with dimensions and assembly breakdowns.

## Modeling Process

### Head & Ears 
- **Sketch Layers**: Implemented four sketch layers to build the head model. Offset planes were used for some parts.
- **Modeling Techniques**: Used Revolve and Extrude/Push for the face and joint hole. The ears were created with built-in joints designed to rotate.
- **Assembly**: The ears were separated from the head, attached to the joints, and offset into the head.
- **Selection Analysis**: View of the model with joint cutouts and assembly preparation.

### Body & Tail 
- **Initial Sketch**: First sketch of the main body, later refined with Revolve.
- **Body Parts**: Neck, shoulders, and ball joint for the head created using Sketch, Revolve, Loft, Offset, and Fillet.
- **Limbs**: Arms and legs modeled with Sketch, Loft, Pipe, Offset, and Fillet.
- **Tail**: Sketch, Pipe, and Fillet used to create the tail, with a socket designed for the ball joint.
- **Socket Size**: The socket's measurement was 1.00mm larger than the ball joint (Engineer3D, 2021).

## Conclusion
The project successfully combined creativity and technical skills to design and model a detailed cat figurine with functional ball joints. Using Fusion 360, the team created a parametric design that allowed for easy modifications and fine-tuning during the modeling process. The figurineâ€™s parts were designed with mobility in mind, and a smooth workflow was maintained throughout the design phase. The printing process highlighted the differences in material handling, and the final model demonstrated a successful integration of design, functionality, and 3D printing techniques. This project provided valuable experience in parametric design, 3D modeling, and the complexities of moving parts in 3D printed models.
